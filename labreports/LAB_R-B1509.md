    B.1 Deliver Food in estimated time
    B.2 Ensure safety of students and faculty
 **User**: Client-side interaction
    U.1 User Account must be associated with payment method, i.e. Falcon Dollars, Credit Card (lessonsLearned.md File Example)
 **Functional**: The functions the system should perform
    F.1 The system must present a precise delivery time prediction prior to allowing the user to confirm the order to help ensure that they will be at the location given ("Hangry Student 2" from lessonsLearned.md File Example, co-worker at Lotties).
    F.2 Resources must be updated after every confirmation of Order and Payment (Self)
    F.3 Check for constraints before final confirmation of Order on the System's side (Self)

## 3. Assumptions
This is an optional section, where system constraints, out of scope features or other caveats can be clearly documented.  
 **Constraints**
  C.1 No food is allowed to be delivered to Hazard Zones, i.e. Science Labs, classes with Chemical Usage, Art Studios due to toxic paints (Co-worker)
  C.1.1 No food allowed in food labs for academic integrity (Faculty Member)
  C.2 There must be a prior agreement that allows for food delivery with the classroom's professor before any confirmation message is sent to the student confirming their order (Faculty Member)
